# zalando

## Unfortunately Zalando discount code delivery time has recently significantly increased. <br> Together with a changed layout, it looks like a countermeasure for this little script.

Short project leveraging Selenium to generate a discount code for Zalando:
* Creates a temporary email address
* Registers an account on Zalando using that email
* Verifies email
* Extracts discount code from message

### Requirements
* Selenium package (via requirements.txt)
* Chrome/Chromium
* Decent connection
* Python 3.4+

### Run main script to get discount code:
```
python3 get_discount_code.py
```
